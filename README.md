Credit Risk Prediction
This project focuses on predicting credit risk using machine learning models. It analyzes financial and demographic features of credit card applicants to classify them as low-risk or high-risk borrowers.

Key Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) for pattern identification

Implementation of multiple ML models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC

Jupyter Notebook with step-by-step workflow

Files Included

Credit_card.ipynb → Complete model-building pipeline

CREDIT RISK PREDICTION.pdf → Project report with explanations

Objective

To build a reliable and interpretable machine learning system that helps financial institutions minimize loan default risks and make better lending decisions.
